# Social-Media-Influence-on-Humans
**OVERVIEW**
This project aims at deriving the correlation between social media and its prevalent effects on human behaviour. Influence of social media engagement on human behaviour is at large seen around the world, here I wish to explore how time spent on social media is affecting mental health and quality of life of a human.

**GOAL**
People today care more about their virtual world (social media account) rather than devoting time on real world. This indeed is a serious problem in young adults who are not capable of making informed decisions and are in high influence of social media. Here, I would be deriving direct relationship between the time spent on any particular social media platform and mental health (like addictive tendancy, suicide ideations, depression, anxiety and quality of life).
